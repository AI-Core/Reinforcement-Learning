We do backup by looking at the final timestep before our agent went into the terminal state - here it is easy to calculate the return. It is simply the reward that we received for moving into this state, because the expected return from the next state (terminal state) is always zero. Then using the recursive expression of returns (above), we can calculate the return for the timestep before that. This can be done recursively until we reach our initial state.
