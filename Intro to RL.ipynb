This brings us to a core challenge in reinforcement learning: **the exploration vs exploitation dilemma**.

    "## How can we find an optimal policy?\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal policy would take the best possible action in any state. Because of this, the optimal value function would give the maximum possible values for any state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line below, the maximum state-value of a state is equivalent to the maximum action-value when taking the best action in that state. Following this, we can derive a recursive definition of the optimal value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last step, we even remove the policy from the equation entirely! This means that value iteration never needs to explicitly represent a policy in terms of a function that takes in a state and returns a distribution over actions.\n",
    "Instead, value iteration uses a **model**, $p(s', r | s, a)$, to look one step ahead, and take the action, $a$, that most likely leads it to the next state that has the best state-value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model** defines how the state changes. It is also known as the transition dynamics of the environment. In our case the model is really simple: we are certain that taking the action to move right will move our agent one space to the right as long as there are no obstacles. There is no randomness in our environment (e.g. no wind that might push us into a different cell when we try to move right). That is, our environment is deterministic, not stochastic.\n",
